# Improved ask method. That ask method I showed you was OK, but I bet you could do better. Try to clean it up by removing the answer variable. Youâ€™ll have to use return to exit from the loop. (Well, it will get you out of the whole method, but it will get you out of the loop in the process.) How do you like the resulting method? I usually try to avoid using return (a personal preference), but I might make an exception here.
