#could do better. Try to clean it up by removing the answer variable. Youâ€™ll

#have to use return to exit from the loop. (Well, it will get you out of the

#whole method, but it will get you out of the loop in the process.) How do

#you like the resulting method? I usually try to avoid using return (a personal
#
#preference), but I might make an exception here.
