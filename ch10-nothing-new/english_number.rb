# Expanded english_number. First, put in thousands; it should return 'one thousand' 
# instead of (the sad) 'ten hundred' and 'ten thousand' instead of 'one hundred hundred'.
# Now expand upon english_number some more. For example, put in millions so you get 
# 'one million' instead of 'one thousand thousand'. Then try adding bil- lions, trillions, and so on.
