    # hundreds we have to write out. After we add "hundreds" to
    # "numString", we add the string ' hundred' after it.

    # 1999 (so "number" = 1999), then at this point "write" would
    # be 19, and "left" would be 99. The laziest thing to do at this

    # then we write out ' hundred', and then the rest of
    # englishNumber writes out 'ninety-nine'.
