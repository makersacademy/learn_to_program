# Shuffle. Now that you’ve finished your new sorting algorithm, how about
# the opposite? Write a shuffle method that takes an array and returns a to-
# tally shuffled version. As always, you’ll want to test it, but testing this
# one is trickier: How can you test to make sure you are getting a perfect
# shuffle? What would you even say a perfect shuffle would be? Now test
# for it.
