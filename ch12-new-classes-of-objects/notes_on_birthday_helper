import text file as an array, with each line separated by newlines.

take names and put them as hash keys
take birthdays and convert them to Time.local, put them as hash values
ask for a name
enter name
program tells you when next birthday will be
program tells you how old person will be

____________________________________________________
create empty hash
read input file and iterate over it using .each_line
    remove newlines
    create counter for substring position
    while loop checks each character in line by using substring set to value of
    counter of substring positioon. when it's not looking at a comma it 
    increments the substring counter then it ends
    the person's name is set to a variable, containing substring 0-comma counter -1
    the bday is set to the last 12 characters of the line
    these are inputted to the array as array[key]=value
    ends

ask whose birthday they want to know
set the answer to a variable
look inside the hash by passing the user input to the hash as a key []

if it's an empty entry print an error. otherwise output the birthday.
