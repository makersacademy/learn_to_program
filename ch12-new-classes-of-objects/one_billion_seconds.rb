    # Now here's a really sly trick:
    hundreds  = english_number write
    numString = numString + hundreds + ' hundred'
    # That's called "recursion". So what did I just do?
    # I told this method to call itself, but with "write" instead of
    # "number". Remember that "write" is (at the moment) the number of
    # hundreds we have to write out. After we add "hundreds" to
    # "numString", we add the string ' hundred' after it.
    # So, for example, if we originally called english_number with
    # 1999 (so "number" = 1999), then at this point "write" would
    # be 19, and "left" would be 99. The laziest thing to do at this
    # point is to have english_number write out the 'nineteen' for us,
    # then we write out ' hundred', and then the rest of
    # english_number writes out 'ninety-nine'.
