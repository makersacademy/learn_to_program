create a hash that assigns a value to each of the letters. 

take roman integer from user, upcase it.

split each character, put them in an array

check each character in the array matches an array of valid characters. abort
program if it does not.

iterate over the array. check whether the next character has a hash value larger
than the character currently being tested. if it does, subtract character from
next character. if it does not, add the value of current character to
int_running_total. repeat with the next pair of characters until the end of the
string is reached. need to add exception for last char, where it is just added?
