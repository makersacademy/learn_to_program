# in order to pass the rspec please follow the below rates of growth, orange production and age of death.
# have your OrangeTree grow by 0.4 per year.
# have it produce no oranges in its first 5 years
# starting in its sixth year have it produce oranges at a rate of (height * 15 - 25) per year.
# have the tree die after 25 years.
# check out the rspec spec/ch13/orange_tree_spec.rb to see what strings we're looking for in the responses.
