# Pasting C. Pine's solution for passing the test,
# as he had different rate of growth, orange production, and
# the way to determine when the tree dies (if the tree is taller
# than 10 meters, it dies at the probability of 50% when it ages).
#
# Also, the tests expect the programme to output exact same strings
# as his programme, and it does not suit the purpose of building our
# own implementation of OrangeTree.
#
# Removed his way of determining the tree's death based on probability
#
# My original is attached at the end.
