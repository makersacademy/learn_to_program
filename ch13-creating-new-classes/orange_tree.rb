# Orange tree. Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method that returns its height 
# and a one_year_passes method that, when called, ages the tree one year. Each year the 
# tree grows taller (however much you think an orange tree should grow in a year), and after 
# some number of years (again, your call) the tree should die. For the first few years, it 
# should not produce fruit, but after a while it should, and I guess that older trees produce 
# more each year than younger trees...whatever you think makes the most sense. And, of course, 
# you should be able to count_the_oranges (which returns the number of oranges on the tree) 
# and pick_an_orange (which reduces the @orange_count by 1 and returns a string telling you 
# how delicious the orange was, or else it just tells you that there are no more oranges to 
# pick this year). Make sure any oranges you donâ€™t pick one year fall off before the next year.

# I did not get on with the test when attempting this. Worked through the solution and 
# understand it much better now though ;)
