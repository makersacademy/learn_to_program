Orange tree.
Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method that returns its height
and a one_year_passes method that, when called, ages the tree one year.
Each year the tree grows taller (however much you think an orange tree should grow in a year),
and after some number of years (again, your call) the tree should die.
For the first few years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while it should,
and I guess that older trees produce more each year than younger trees...
whatever you think makes the most sense.
And, of course, you should be able to count_the_oranges (which returns the number of oranges on the tree)
and pick_an_orange (which reduces the @orange_count by 1 and returns a string telling you how delicious
the orange was, or else it just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this year).
Make sure any oranges you donâ€™t pick one year fall off before the next year.
