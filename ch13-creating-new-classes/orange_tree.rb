# Orange tree. Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method that returns its height
# and a one_year_passes method that, when called, ages the tree one year. Each year the
# tree grows taller (however much you think an orange tree should grow in a year), and
# after some number of years (again, your call) the tree should die. For the first few
# years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while it should, and I guess that older
# trees produce more each year than younger trees...whatever you think makes the most
# sense. And, of course, you should be able to count_the_oranges (which returns the number
# of oranges on the tree) and pick_an_orange (which reduces the @orange_count by 1 and
# returns a string telling you how delicious the orange was, or else it just tells you
# that there are no more oranges to pick this year). Make sure any oranges you donâ€™t pick
# one year fall off before the next year.

# in order to pass the rspec please follow the below rates of growth, orange production and age of death.
# have your OrangeTree grow by 0.4 per year.
# have it produce no oranges in its first 5 years
# starting in its sixth year have it produce oranges at a rate of (height * 15 - 25) per year.
# have the tree die after 25 years.
# check out the rspec spec/ch13/orange_tree_spec.rb to see what strings we're looking for in the responses.
