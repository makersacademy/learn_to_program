# Better program logger. The output from that last logger was kind of hard
# to read, and it would just get worse the more you used it. It would be so
# much easier to read if it indented the lines in the inner blocks. So, youâ€™ll
# need to keep track of how deeply nested you are every time the logger
# wants to write something. To do this, use a global variable, which is a
# variable you can see from anywhere in your code. To make a global variable,
# just precede your variable name with $ , like so: $global , $nesting_depth ,
# and $big_top_pee_wee . In the end, your logger should output code like this:
#
# Beginning "outer block"...
#   Beginning "some little block"...
#     Beginning "teeny-tiny block"...
#     ..."teeny-tiny block" finished, returning:
#     lots of love
#   ..."some little block" finished, returning:
#   42
#   Beginning "yet another block"...
#   ..."yet another block" finished, returning:
#   I love Indian food!
# ..."outer block" finished, returning:
# true
