# Even better profiling. After you do your profiling, see the slow parts of your
# program, and either make them faster or learn to love them as they are,
# you probably don’t want to see all of that profiling anymore. But (I hope)
# you’re too lazy to go back and delete it all...especially because you might
# want to use it again someday. Modify the profile method so you can turn
# all profiling on and off by changing just one line of code. Just one word!
