# had a block (pardon the pun) for some reason on this one...guess it's the nesting, which is clear to me now after following through this.

def log desc, &block
  puts 'Beginning "' + desc + '"...'
  result = block.call
  puts '..."' + desc + '" finished, returning: ' + result.to_s
end

log 'outer block' do
  log 'some little block' do
    1**1 + 2**2
  end

  log 'yet another block' do
    '!doof iahT ekil I'.reverse
  end

  '0' == 0
end
