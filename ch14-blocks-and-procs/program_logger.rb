# Program logger. Write a method called log that takes a string description
# of a block (and, of course, a block). Similar to the method do_self_importantly,
# it should puts a string telling you it started the block and another string
# at the end telling you it finished and also telling you what the block
# returned. Test your method by sending it a code block. Inside the block,
# put another call to log, passing a block to it. In other words, your output
# should look something like this:
# Beginning "outer block"...
# Beginning "some little block"...
# ..."some little block" finished, returning:
# 5
# Beginning "yet another block"...
# ..."yet another block" finished, returning:
# I like Thai food!
# ..."outer block" finished, returning: false
